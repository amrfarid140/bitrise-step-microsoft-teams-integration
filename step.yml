        * section_subtitle
        * section_text

  - section_title: $GIT_CLONE_COMMIT_AUTHOR_NAME
    opts:
      category: "MessageCard Content"
      title: "Section Title"
      summary: "Text that is displayed within the MessageCard Section `activityTitle`"
      description: |

    opts:
      category: "MessageCard Content"
      title: "Section Subtitle"

        Sets the text value of `text` within the primary Section of the MessageCard. By default,
        this will be set to the commit message body that triggered the build.

        If desired, this is the perfect place to include release notes via the `generate-changelog` Bitrise step, however
        setting `enable_primary_section_markdown` to `true` may be necessary to properly format the changelog content.

  - section_header_image:
    opts:
      category: "MessageCard Content"
      title: "Section Image"
      summary: "Image that is displayed within the MessageCard Section `activityImage`"

  - enable_default_actions: true
    opts:
      category: "MessageCard Actions"
      title: "Default MessageCard Actions"
      summary: "Toggles the default actions within the MessageCard."
      description: |
        Allows for disabling the default 'Go To Repo' and 'Go To Build' MessageCard Actions if you wish to provide only your own custom actions 
        via the `actions` step input (up to a limit of 4 actions in total).

  - actions: "[]"
    opts:
      category: "MessageCard Actions"
      title: "MessageCard Actions"
      summary: "Additional extra custom actions to display on the MessageCard"
      description: |
        A stringified JSON object array of additional custom actions to display on the card.

        The maximum amount of actions a single card can display is 4, 2 of which are used if 
        `enable_default_actions` is set to `true`.

        Each action button object must have a `text` key/value pair, and a list of `target` objects
        which define the `uri`, specific to which platform-client (`os` value) the Teams message is viewed on.

        Valid `os` values are (case-sensitive):

        * iOS
        * android
        * windows
        * default (shows action button on every Teams client, regardless of platform)

        NOTE: Step input must be valid JSON. Trailing commas are not permitted.

        Example input:
        ```json
        [
          {
            "text": "Open deep link", 
            "targets": [
              {
                "uri": "your_universal_link",
                "os": "iOS"
              },
              {
                "uri": "your_android_app_link",
                "os": "android"
              },
              {
                "uri": "https://www.google.com",
                "os": "default"
              }
            ]
          }                  
        ]
        ```
        While this isn't the most user-friendly way to define custom buttons, Bitrise step
        parsing is currently limited to string value inputs and does not allow defining a YAML object list, which
        has been [feature requested here](https://github.com/bitrise-io/go-steputils/issues/23).

  - repository_url: $GIT_REPOSITORY_URL
    opts:
      title: "Repository URL"
      summary: "Define a custom repository location"
      description: |
        If no value is given, the step automatically uses the `$GIT_REPOSITORY_URL` var.

        If a Bitrise project is configured via SSH, `$GIT_REPOSITORY_URL` is not a useable
        URI Target for the MessageCard, so this allows for overriding this value if SSH is configured.

  - webhook_url:
    opts:
      title: "Incoming Webhook URL"
      summary: "Url of the Incoming Webhook generated by Microsoft Teams"
      description: |
        * Go to Microsoft Teams
        * Click on the three dots next to channel name then **Add Connector**
        * Select **Incoming Webhook* and in the text input type **Bitrise**
        * Save and copy the link to the input for this step
